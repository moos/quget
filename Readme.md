```

## Installation
`npm install -g quget`

## Features

## When I would use JSDOM

Cheerio will not solve all your problems. I would still use JSDOM if I needed to work in a browser-like environment on the server, particularly if I wanted to automate functional tests.

## API


### Miscellaneous
DOM element methods that don't fit anywhere else
